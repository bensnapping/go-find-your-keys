# go-find-your-keys
A short text adventure game about finding your keys in a slightly messy room. 

This project was written entirely in assembly, and used an MSP432P401R Launchpad Microcontroller from Texas Instruments, a 16x2 1602A LCD Display, and two switches. The wiring itself is relatively simple. The vast majority of the effort here was put into the code, which is available in this repository. It was completed entirely by me over the course of around a week in Fall of 2021.
